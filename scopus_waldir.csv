In the service of mobile computing, education has now led to the implementation of mobile learning (m-learning). Not only to access educational resources quickly but m-learning also contributes to allowing a wide-ranging collaboration between users as learners. Supported by cloud technology, m-learning nowadays has shown its potential solution in making larger capacity and shorter processes. How-ever, a cloud-based learning architecture would only enhance the power of data storing for the applications. The implementation with the growth of billions of various devices which still needs improvements due to computing performance and content delivery need to put the consideration of fog computing as an opportunity to create an effective and efficient educational service. This paper discusses the current implementation of fog technology including a comparative analysis regarding each type of learning situations in m-learning networked environments by using a comprehensive review and expert evaluation.

Besides, they play a crucial role in equipping learners with practical skills and fostering hands-on experience to defend against cyber-attacks. Many Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in developed countries have already embraced the promise of CC to raise educational standards. However, the pace of its adoption in developing countries has stagnated. Moreover, existing solutions in the literature are not sustainable. They either rely on on-premise infrastructure or are bound by a single cloud service provider. Consequently, they are likely prone to failures and a sudden outage. To fill this gap, this paper is a first that comprehensively addresses the above issues and introduces a federated hybrid CC system based on an extension of Apache Virtual Computing Lab (VCL). The proposed system provides an independent open-source implementation, greater configuration flexibility, and methodological improvements as compared to existing studies in the literature. In addition, it promotes the sustainability of the CC services, extensible cloud architecture, and fault tolerance. VCL is primarily focused on provisioning Virtual Laboratories (VL) for remote cybersecurity and computer networks education, with potential expansion to other domains of engineering education. In addition, this paper introduces GPT-TerminalPro, a terminal-based tool driven by OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT-3.5) that provides intelligent assistance to users while performing lab tasks. To experimentally evaluate the VCL's performance, the standard Linux tools as well as the Apache benchmark and httperf HTTP load generators are utilized. VCL has been tested with 30 users and 61 virtual user computing environments provisioning to validate the overall performance. The results are fascinating: the provisioning time including all VCL background tasks is always less than a minute and utilizes fewer computing resources while providing a better user experience. This paper will encourage the adoption of CC in low-income countries. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It is an extension of cloud computing and is an essential concept in IoT (Internet of Things), as it reduces the burden of processing in cloud computing. It brings intelligence and processing closer to where the data is created and transmitted to other sources. Fog computing has many benefits, such as reduced latency in processing data, better response time that helps the user’s experience, and security and privacy compliance that assures protecting the vital data in the cloud. It also reduces the cost of bandwidth, because the processing is achieved in the cloud, which reduces network bandwidth usage and increases efficiency as user devices share data in the local processing infrastructure rather than the cloud service. Fog computing has various applications across industries, such as agriculture and farming, the healthcare industry, smart cities, education, and entertainment. For example, in the agriculture industry, a very prominent example is the SWAMP project, which stands for Smart Water Management Platform. With fog computing’s help, SWAMP develops a precision-based smart irrigation system concept used in agriculture, minimizing water wastage. This book is divided into three sections. The first section studies fog computing and machine learning, covering fog computing architecture, application perspective, computational offloading in mobile cloud computing, intelligent Cloud-IoT systems, machine learning fundamentals, and data visualization. The second section focuses on applications and analytics, spanning various applications of fog computing, such as in healthcare, Industry 4.0, cancer cell detection systems, smart farming, and precision farming. This section also covers analytics in fog computing using big data and patient monitoring systems, and the emergence of fog computing concerning applications and potentialities in traditional and digital educational systems. Security aspects in fog computing through blockchain and IoT, and fine-grained access through attribute-based encryption for fog computing are also covered. Audience The book will be read by researchers and engineers in computer science, information technology, electronics, and communication specializing in machine learning, deep learning, the cyber world, IoT, and security systems. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Book","Final","","Scopus"

Faced with a large number of music education resources, users are often difficult to choose. A system architecture based on the combination of edge computing (EC) and cloud computing (CC) is proposed to optimize the scheduling strategy of educational resources. The present work first briefly introduces the combination and advantages of EC and CC technology, and analyzes the demand for educational resource scheduling. The contribution and innovation of the research are to introduce EC into the technical scheme of piano music resource scheduling to improve the network and system architecture of the platform. The application results show that the resource utilization rate of the proposed multi-round iterative resource scheduling algorithm is 29% higher than that of the basic genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO), the user waiting time is reduced by 15%, and the system efficiency is improved by 23%. This shows that, compared with the traditional resource scheduling strategy, the proposed resource scheduling strategy can reduce delay, improve system efficiency and resource utilization, and improve service level. The research results contribute to support new teaching forms, improve platform application performance and intelligent level, and further improve user experience. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Article","Final","","Scopus"
